# UMN Week 1 Project, Code Refactor

## From starter code, refactor for accessibility. 

Horiseon SEO wants their site to be accessible, however the initial build of the site was not done with this in mind.  
This project is taking this site from non-accessible CSS/HTML standards to accessible.  Replacing ``<div>`` where
appropriate, adding alt attributes, etc.
